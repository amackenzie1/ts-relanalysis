2024-04-24, 4:45 p.m. - Jose Walter: Do I still call u?
2024-04-24, 4:46 p.m. - Valentino MB: Hello Ms Tarhini,

I have recently tried to replace my Fina 395 lecture CB class with Fina 395 lecture CA class for summer 2024 (second half), but have found myself unable as I do not have "requisites". Being currently enrolled in Fina 395 lecture CB, I find this quite odd.

Is this error due to a misconfiguration of the class?

Speaking of requisites, I currently am enrolled in summer 1 for COMM 309 and in FINA 385 for summer 2 as instructed by my COOP schedule.

It seems there is already an error even before when looking at the page before pressing "finish swapping".

I hope that you can help me with this slight issue as the lecture CA is most convenient for me.

Best regards
Valentino Magniette-Bosseboeuf

2024-06-03, 4:09 p.m. - Jose Walter: The problem is that concordia University Wi-Fi asks for a username and password and concordia guests ask you for like a temporary ID so what we can do is maybe go to IT or someone and tell them yo we’re gonna half around 20 guests for Miguel for a competition and we need like they’re gonna bring their laptops and the only thing we need is an access code for the Wi-Fi that’s one way to solve it the other possibility is just to ask for a temporary and username and passwords so that they can access the lab computers and then we can I’ll trade
