[4/3/24, 1:42:02 PM] Matthieu Huss: What’s up finally
[4/3/24, 1:42:27 PM] Andrew: (Idk if you know Alan Ginsberg, but this seems to be a similar philosophical conclusion to Siddhartha: just pure existential positive, "everything is sacred": https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54163/footnote-to-howl)
[4/3/24, 1:43:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: I really have to read that book again
[4/3/24, 1:43:49 PM] Matthieu Huss: Do you get it from the library ?
[4/3/24, 1:46:46 PM] Andrew: I actually got it from this girl Victory last week
[4/3/24, 1:47:05 PM] Andrew: Would offer you this copy but she also wants to read it again so she might be asking for it back

[4/9/24, 8:34:46 AM] Andrew: Ooh Hungarian Dance!! Nicely played!
[4/9/24, 8:35:13 AM] Andrew: Which version is this? I tried learning the 4 hands version transcribed for 2 hands and it was pretty gnarly
[4/9/24, 2:07:55 PM] Matthieu Huss: If u search Brahms Hungarian dance sheet music it should come up
[4/9/24, 2:08:47 PM] Matthieu Huss: Not too difficult, but lots of different interpretations online
[4/15/24, 5:02:26 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hey man how’re you going?
[4/15/24, 5:02:59 PM] Matthieu Huss: I have an interview coming up with citadel, would u mind giving a quick summary of the technical questions asked during ur Hudson interview ?
[4/15/24, 5:03:41 PM] Andrew: Ooh!! Congrats on getting that!
[4/15/24, 5:04:04 PM] Andrew: They were asking me stats/probability questions
[4/15/24, 5:05:53 PM] Andrew: I don’t remember all the specifics, but one was “if you have 100 coin flips and only 30 are tails, what’s the significance if you were to claim the coin was biased?”
[4/15/24, 5:13:47 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh easy, just significance testing - what was the question you said tripped u up ?
[4/15/24, 5:14:01 PM] Matthieu Huss: Also r u around this weekend?
[4/15/24, 5:14:13 PM] Matthieu Huss: Drinks shall be on me
[4/15/24, 5:32:02 PM] Andrew: literally that one lmao
[4/15/24, 5:32:21 PM] Andrew: I was trying to get the variance of the binomial distribution
[4/15/24, 5:32:41 PM] Andrew: and forgot that I could just break it into the sum of variances of bernoulli distributions
[4/15/24, 5:33:57 PM] Andrew: Yes! And how could I refuse 😄
[4/15/24, 5:38:44 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ah that’s rough
[4/15/24, 5:39:25 PM] Matthieu Huss: Can t test hypothesis with null mean = 0 and alternative mean != 0 and take the p value
[4/15/24, 5:39:44 PM] Matthieu Huss: U Probably were expecting something complicated haha
[4/15/24, 5:39:59 PM] Matthieu Huss: Perfect, I’ll find something
[4/15/24, 5:39:59 PM] Andrew: yup yup...

[4/20/24, 9:49:06 AM] Andrew: What were your calculations?
[4/20/24, 9:49:22 AM] Andrew: Did your probability estimate not take into account the weather forecast lol?
[4/20/24, 9:51:06 AM] Matthieu Huss: It said it would be overcast today for me :(
[4/20/24, 9:51:35 AM] Matthieu Huss: I factored that in with the previous day rain and estimated a high confidence of wet ground
[4/20/24, 9:51:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: For 95% of iid samples
[4/20/24, 9:53:23 AM] Andrew: Okay fancy. I just looked and saw it saying 12-ish degrees.

[4/27/24, 10:28:00 AM] Andrew: Aw man… looks like I might miss this, I’m going to be in Ottawa on the 29th
[4/27/24, 10:28:54 AM] Andrew: If you get some photos, though, I would love to see all the togas people come up with
[4/27/24, 1:48:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: Aw okay no worries
[4/27/24, 1:48:37 PM] Matthieu Huss: Will do
[5/1/24, 12:59:00 AM] Matthieu Huss: Finished atlas shrugged
[5/1/24, 12:59:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: That speech was a slog
[5/1/24, 7:59:56 AM] Andrew: Oh the last John Galt one?
[5/1/24, 8:00:10 AM] Andrew: So you’re telling me you haven’t been entirely converted to Objectivism? :P
[5/1/24, 8:00:24 AM] Andrew: What did you think of the book overall?
[5/1/24, 1:51:04 PM] Matthieu Huss: I really liked it, it’s very obvious why this is every finance guys favorite book lol
[5/1/24, 1:51:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: Maybe not a subscriber to pure unfettered capitalism, but yes i do agree with how people nowadays think people should be served based on need rather than ability
[5/1/24, 1:52:03 PM] Matthieu Huss: While the end goal should be to give people resources so they can provide for themselves, not just straight subsistence living
[5/1/24, 1:52:18 PM] Matthieu Huss: What about you ?
[5/3/24, 2:41:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: Will u be back in mtl in next week ?
[5/3/24, 2:43:44 PM] Andrew: I'm gonna be back in Montreal after the 11th, I'm going to a friend's wedding
[5/3/24, 2:45:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ah ok ok, I’ll head out on the 12
[5/3/24, 2:45:53 PM] Matthieu Huss: How’s Ottawa ?
[5/3/24, 2:46:03 PM] Andrew: Aw alright, we might just miss each other then...
[5/3/24, 2:46:21 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah we will see ;(
[5/3/24, 2:46:36 PM] Matthieu Huss: My parents are coming by then but idk if they decided to stay the weekend
[5/3/24, 2:46:54 PM] Andrew: Ottawa (or rather the middle of nowhere Quebec) is very quiet, nice fresh spring vibes here
[5/3/24, 2:47:09 PM] Matthieu Huss: Sounds delightful
[5/3/24, 2:47:14 PM] Matthieu Huss: You’re missing out here tho
[5/3/24, 2:47:23 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s been raining 🤩 for 3 days straight
[5/3/24, 2:47:28 PM] Matthieu Huss: Well stopped yesterday
[5/3/24, 2:47:32 PM] Andrew: Hahaha :D
[5/3/24, 2:49:03 PM] Andrew: I have to say I read it a while ago so my thoughts are probably not all that intelligent. I remember really enjoying the book and thoroughly despising the characters who were meant to be despised, but also feeling like the philosophy was rather too harsh (even though it's probably targeted at exactly our demographic.)
[5/3/24, 2:49:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah that’s my major criticism, rather black and white
[5/3/24, 2:49:44 PM] Matthieu Huss: The charitable characters are all impotent, no one is well meaning and actually able to do anything
[5/3/24, 2:49:57 PM] Andrew: It feels like something right out of Japanese poems
‎[5/3/24, 2:50:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000150-PHOTO-2024-05-03-14-50-33.jpg>
[5/3/24, 2:50:38 PM] Andrew: I forget, are there even well-meaning charitable characters? Or are they all revealed to be horrible deep down?
[5/3/24, 2:50:39 PM] Matthieu Huss: Place I want to visit in Japan
[5/3/24, 2:50:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: If you guys got that in Ottawa I’ll pull up tmrw
[5/3/24, 2:50:52 PM] Andrew: Woahhhh
[5/3/24, 2:51:09 PM] Andrew: Where is this?
[5/3/24, 2:51:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Pretty much all horrible, the brother, the government, even Sadler in the end
[5/3/24, 2:51:30 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hitachi seaside park
[5/3/24, 2:51:36 PM] Matthieu Huss: In Japan
[5/3/24, 2:51:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: I think the only reversal was the guy who worked for rearden
[5/3/24, 2:52:00 PM] Matthieu Huss: Who he found dying at the end
[5/3/24, 2:52:26 PM] Matthieu Huss: But yeah every other character stayed greedy/hiding behind the facade of helping others
[5/3/24, 2:59:17 PM] Andrew: Man I need to visit this country
[5/3/24, 2:59:39 PM] Andrew: I totally forgot about this guy!
[5/3/24, 3:01:38 PM] Matthieu Huss: I know man, jealous of my parents haha
[5/3/24, 3:01:44 PM] Matthieu Huss: One day tho
[5/5/24, 1:39:39 PM] Andrew: Hey Matthieu, have you seen Dr. Strangelove?
[5/5/24, 2:04:13 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm never heard of it
[5/5/24, 2:04:53 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s about the Cold War ?
[5/5/24, 2:15:52 PM] Andrew: Yep
[5/5/24, 2:16:12 PM] Andrew: I just saw it yesterday and it’s one of the most perfect movies I’ve seen
[5/5/24, 2:16:25 PM] Andrew: Highly recommend :D
[5/5/24, 4:02:10 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh really
[5/5/24, 4:02:16 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll check it out for sure then
[5/6/24, 1:45:39 PM] Matthieu Huss: Btw before I forget - is there any time you’ll be at ur place when I can pick up unbearable lightness of being ?
[5/6/24, 1:51:09 PM] Andrew: I'm not sure if I'm going to be back early enough on the 12th, but my apartment should be unlocked, if you'd like you can just get it! Otherwise I'll mail it to wherever you are.
[5/6/24, 1:58:56 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm I remember the front door being locked though no ?
[5/6/24, 1:59:12 PM] Matthieu Huss: If not it’s no worries, I can pick it up next fall as well
[5/6/24, 2:00:36 PM] Andrew: Ah maybe. If you look me up in the little screen directory there and call me I can open the door remotely. But yeah next fall would also work.
[5/6/24, 2:00:56 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh sick! Okay I’ll probably do that then this week
[5/6/24, 2:00:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll lyk
[5/6/24, 2:01:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: R u planning on going to New York / USA btw ?
[5/6/24, 2:01:38 PM] Andrew: Tentatively planning on going on the 23rd!
[5/6/24, 2:02:34 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh sick, let me know! I should be in New York by then
[5/6/24, 2:02:51 PM] Andrew: Oh you're gonna be in New York? I thought Chicago!
[5/6/24, 2:03:10 PM] Matthieu Huss: New York in the end
[5/6/24, 2:03:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Chicago is maybe in fall or something
[5/6/24, 2:03:25 PM] Matthieu Huss: Also have follow up interview with citadel
[5/6/24, 2:03:28 PM] Andrew: Sick! NYC proper?
[5/6/24, 2:03:32 PM] Matthieu Huss: So tbh I have no idea anymore haha
[5/6/24, 2:03:39 PM] Matthieu Huss: The company I’ll work for is in Manhattan
[5/6/24, 2:03:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: Probably will stay in Long Island and commute tho
[5/6/24, 2:03:54 PM] Andrew: Amazing, okay, that's where I'll be
[5/6/24, 2:04:11 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ok nice, yeah let me know and we can tour around

[5/6/24, 2:04:25 PM] Andrew: Amazing, will do!
[5/6/24, 2:04:50 PM] Andrew: Hahaha hope your chess is still sharp :D
[5/6/24, 2:05:19 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll practice before 😉

[5/14/24, 10:08:05 AM] Andrew: I'm really looking forward to trying it, I think it's going to feel even more insane when we're doing this live
[5/14/24, 2:15:43 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yah just the voice thing Is already sick, the facial features is next level
[5/14/24, 2:16:03 PM] Andrew: Like it being able to see your expression?
[5/14/24, 3:49:01 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, like it can tell your emotion by facial features
[5/14/24, 3:54:14 PM] Andrew: Yeah no I can't wait to get my hands on it :D

[5/23/24, 7:03:55 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll be there until end of August in my own place though if u come down again
[5/23/24, 7:04:27 PM] Andrew: Oh haha!! Alright then, I guess I’ll see you a bit later then.
[5/23/24, 7:05:02 PM] Matthieu Huss: 👌of course
[5/23/24, 7:05:08 PM] Matthieu Huss: Should come visit Boston too

[5/24/24, 12:57:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: reading list for NY, got any suggestions ?
[5/24/24, 2:04:12 PM] Andrew: Ooh, will think. I don’t recognize most of these books, so you’ll have to tell me what you think when you read them
[5/24/24, 2:04:25 PM] Andrew: NYC feels like Trantor
[5/24/24, 2:58:25 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah
[5/24/24, 2:58:40 PM] Matthieu Huss: Look on top of the tall buildings, you’ll be able to see the helicopters
[5/24/24, 2:58:54 PM] Andrew: Oooh

[5/24/24, 2:59:10 PM] Andrew: We’re going to go up one world trade, maybe will be visible from there
[5/24/24, 2:59:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh nice
[5/24/24, 2:59:45 PM] Andrew: This is awesome, where’s it taken from?
[5/24/24, 2:59:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: Never been, always go to Empire State
[5/24/24, 2:59:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: My hotel for the week I was there lol
[5/24/24, 3:00:05 PM] Matthieu Huss: Now I need to find my own place
[5/24/24, 3:00:06 PM] Andrew: Woah
[5/24/24, 3:00:09 PM] Matthieu Huss: For next 3 months
[5/24/24, 3:00:20 PM] Andrew: Good luck

[5/24/24, 3:00:45 PM] Matthieu Huss: Some nice high up restaurants too, should check one out
[5/24/24, 3:00:53 PM] Andrew: Woah
[5/24/24, 3:01:00 PM] Andrew: Yeah good idea
[5/24/24, 3:01:06 PM] Andrew: We went to a rooftop bar yesterday
[5/24/24, 3:01:08 PM] Matthieu Huss: Also if u have time
[5/24/24, 3:01:26 PM] Matthieu Huss: Check out levain bakery
[5/24/24, 3:01:30 PM] Matthieu Huss: Best cookies I’ve ever had
[5/24/24, 3:01:38 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh sickkk

[5/24/24, 3:02:14 PM] Matthieu Huss: Boss took us out for drinks haha
[5/24/24, 3:02:19 PM] Matthieu Huss: Love New York working life so far
[5/25/24, 3:48:29 PM] Andrew: I’m so jealous haha, just realizing that I want to work here too
[5/26/24, 8:00:56 PM] Matthieu Huss: you totally could and should
[5/26/24, 9:27:32 PM] Andrew: I’m gonna give myself a bit of time to think, but seriously like this idea more than California ‎<This message was edited>
[5/27/24, 3:51:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: you’ll love california regardless im sure
[5/27/24, 3:51:51 PM] Matthieu Huss: but yeah, pop over for an internship or two to see what u prefer
[6/3/24, 11:40:19 PM] Andrew: Hey Matthieu! So I was thinking about your question, if I had a recommendation it might be A Personal Matter by Kenzoburo Oe. It left a pretty strong impression on me a couple years ago.
[6/3/24, 11:40:29 PM] Andrew: Anything you’d recommend?
[6/4/24, 5:27:57 PM] Matthieu Huss: Right now I’m finishing up the symposium by Plato, nothing perspective shattering but the logic chains are pretty satisfying
[6/4/24, 5:28:28 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm never heard of it, I’ll check it out in Boston
[6/4/24, 5:28:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: Btw check out what I’ve come by once again
‎[6/4/24, 5:29:07 PM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000259-VIDEO-2024-06-04-17-29-07.mp4>
[6/4/24, 5:29:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Gotta come back and make use of it 😤
[6/4/24, 5:29:36 PM] Andrew: Oooh
[6/4/24, 5:29:40 PM] Andrew: How long are you in NYC for?
[6/4/24, 5:30:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Until end of August
[6/4/24, 5:30:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’m spending a few weeks in Boston while my parents travel though
[6/4/24, 5:30:55 PM] Matthieu Huss: To look after the dog
[6/4/24, 5:31:30 PM] Andrew: Okay cool! Are you getting an apartment in the end?
[6/4/24, 5:32:45 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, still undecided on a specific place though. Did a few tours but they were all a bit disgusting tbh
[6/4/24, 5:32:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: So still looking
[6/4/24, 5:32:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: Living in Jersey rn
[6/4/24, 5:33:14 PM] Andrew: Okay, from what I've heard Jersey's a pretty common choice
[6/4/24, 5:34:07 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s really not bad, I quite like my place now. Would prefer to be in the city though, makes exploring easier
[6/4/24, 5:34:13 PM] Matthieu Huss: As I can just drop my stuff off after work
[6/4/24, 5:34:13 PM] Andrew: Do you think you'd have room if I were to come for a weekend at some point?
[6/4/24, 5:34:22 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah for sure
[6/4/24, 5:34:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: I mean I’m still looking but like 90% yes
[6/4/24, 5:34:45 PM] Andrew: Sick, alright.
[6/4/24, 5:35:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: Btw when r u headed to califnornia?
[6/4/24, 5:35:26 PM] Andrew: The current plan is January
[6/4/24, 5:35:33 PM] Andrew: Right after I graduate
[6/4/24, 5:35:39 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ahh, not the summer ?
[6/4/24, 5:35:43 PM] Andrew: But it's still a little up in the air
[6/4/24, 5:35:56 PM] Matthieu Huss: In terms of where you’ll work ?
[6/4/24, 5:36:10 PM] Andrew: Yeah, I'm not 100% sure I'll be continuing with this company
[6/4/24, 5:36:32 PM] Andrew: Yup no, I'm in Ottawa for the summer, and then back to Montreal to finish my thesis this fall.
[6/4/24, 5:36:55 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ah i c ic, should come to New York with all the quants haha
[6/4/24, 5:37:04 PM] Matthieu Huss: Nice nice, what’s the topic ?
[6/4/24, 5:38:03 PM] Andrew: Related to this: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19585
[6/4/24, 5:38:24 PM] Andrew: That would be awesome. ‎<This message was edited>
[6/4/24, 5:39:28 PM] Matthieu Huss: So using definitiveness of covariance matrices to determine an optimal learning method ?
[6/4/24, 5:41:07 PM] Andrew: Basically we're looking at a bunch of different learning methods on least squares problems, deriving deterministic loss dynamics in the high dimensional limit, finding optimal hyperparameters, and comparing.
[6/4/24, 5:42:49 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm interesting, is this not determined on the characteristics of data though?
[6/4/24, 5:42:59 PM] Matthieu Huss: Skedasricity, latent variables etc
[6/4/24, 5:43:09 PM] Matthieu Huss: Wow skedasticity*
[6/4/24, 5:43:25 PM] Andrew: Yeah yeah, we're currently just using Gaussian-distributed data for the math
[6/4/24, 5:43:54 PM] Andrew: But it turns out that a bunch of real-life stuff follows similar patterns, we were trying this on CIFAR and it matched our analysis
[6/4/24, 5:44:31 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm not familiar with CIFAR, is it just like kaggle ?
[6/4/24, 5:44:31 PM] Andrew: It's a little more theoretical than it is directly relevant though
[6/4/24, 5:44:47 PM] Andrew: it's just a low-res image dataset
[6/4/24, 5:44:55 PM] Andrew: kinda like the MNIST numbers
[6/4/24, 5:44:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ah
[6/4/24, 5:45:07 PM] Matthieu Huss: So it’s a vision project ?
[6/4/24, 5:45:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: Or for other applications too
[6/4/24, 5:45:45 PM] Andrew: That dataset is, yeah. We're not specifically looking at vision though, just anything that we can use a very shallow neural net for
[6/4/24, 5:46:06 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm, what’s the “efficiency criteria” though
[6/4/24, 5:46:06 PM] Andrew: Sorry gotta run get on a call
[6/4/24, 5:46:12 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah no worries
[6/4/24, 5:46:28 PM] Matthieu Huss: Bcuz some problems are better solved by specific architecture etc,
[6/4/24, 5:46:59 PM] Andrew: oh yeah no 100%
[6/4/24, 5:47:11 PM] Andrew: this is not directly practically relevant
[6/4/24, 5:47:22 PM] Andrew: bc no one uses one-layer neural nets in practice
[6/4/24, 5:50:00 PM] Andrew: but even one-layer neural nets end up being non-trivial to analyze and no one has fully done it
[6/6/24, 9:56:10 AM] Matthieu Huss: R u trying to do the anthropic route of mapping what features the neurons correspond to ?
[6/6/24, 11:08:42 AM] Andrew: Not in this specific project, but that's been at the back of my mind for a while as fun experiment to try.
[6/13/24, 10:35:25 AM] Matthieu Huss: How do you go about doing that though? Take the parameters and fit them in a logistic regression with the dependent variable being the key term you’re trying to find in the network ?
[6/13/24, 10:35:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Btw reading Anna Katerina
[6/13/24, 10:35:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: So good
[6/13/24, 10:35:52 AM] Andrew: Anna Karenina?
[6/13/24, 10:36:01 AM] Matthieu Huss: Tolstoy really started the trend of telling the conclusion at the beginning
[6/13/24, 10:36:05 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ye
[6/13/24, 10:36:28 AM] Andrew: Yeah!! I absolutely loved that one, it's so real.
[6/13/24, 10:37:28 AM] Matthieu Huss: Wonder how he gained his knowledge about the different positions
[6/13/24, 10:37:39 AM] Matthieu Huss: Like the habits of the Russian nobility men or women
[6/13/24, 10:37:57 AM] Andrew: It feels like he's had several lifetimes...
[6/13/24, 10:38:00 AM] Matthieu Huss: Men would make sense, and maybe because I’m just a dude but I feel like the women r so realistically written lol
[6/13/24, 10:38:11 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll have to pass it to my girlfriend to see if she agrees
[6/13/24, 10:38:24 AM] Matthieu Huss: But yes, all characters feel so realistically written
[6/13/24, 10:38:31 AM] Andrew: Yeah exactly...
[6/13/24, 10:38:32 AM] Matthieu Huss: Especially Levin
[6/13/24, 10:39:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: The motivation not having to be tied to the overall “overcoming morality of the time”
[6/13/24, 10:39:10 AM] Andrew: Yeah, I think Levin is probably the closest to Tolstoy himself
[6/13/24, 10:39:46 AM] Matthieu Huss: Also just the micro movements
[6/13/24, 10:39:53 AM] Matthieu Huss: You always hear abt abolishment of serfdom
[6/13/24, 10:40:11 AM] Matthieu Huss: But never actually how it progressed / actually moved that way
[6/13/24, 10:40:37 AM] Andrew: Right yup, and that it actually wasn't a cleanly solvable problem
[6/13/24, 10:40:39 AM] Andrew: How far in are you?
[6/13/24, 10:40:56 AM] Matthieu Huss: And it’s not just “you believe in tenants serfdom you’re cruel and hate peasants” and “you want to free serfs you’re moral in everything”
[6/13/24, 10:40:59 AM] Matthieu Huss: 344 pages
[6/13/24, 10:41:19 AM] Matthieu Huss: At the point where Anna confessed to her husband and is talking with her lover
[6/13/24, 10:41:41 AM] Andrew: Aha okay, nice, so a good bit into the story.
[6/13/24, 10:41:53 AM] Andrew: Exactly
[6/13/24, 10:42:29 AM] Matthieu Huss: And it’s interesting when you hear about tolstoys personal views outside the book
[6/13/24, 10:42:38 AM] Matthieu Huss: Apparently he disliked the whole concept of marriage
[6/13/24, 10:42:38 AM] Andrew: If you find more books like this, please let me know...
[6/13/24, 10:42:41 AM] Andrew: Oh wait really!
[6/13/24, 10:42:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: But it’s not like you see the institution being railed on in his books at all
[6/13/24, 10:42:51 AM] Andrew: That doesn't seem to show through
[6/13/24, 10:42:56 AM] Matthieu Huss: Exactly
[6/13/24, 10:43:07 AM] Andrew: No, I mean especially looking at Levin, Tolstoy seems very pro-marriage
[6/13/24, 10:43:33 AM] Matthieu Huss: Like you can kind of fit the opinion when you read things like the husband being constrained by his marriage with Anna and acting immorally around this
[6/13/24, 10:43:44 AM] Matthieu Huss: As in he uses it as a “moral” front to keep his regulation intact
[6/13/24, 10:43:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: Without actual sanctity for the idea itself
[6/13/24, 10:44:07 AM] Andrew: Ahh... interesting...
[6/13/24, 10:44:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: But it’s like you can find the criticism if you knew his opinion beforehand
[6/13/24, 10:44:39 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’m sure if it was the opposite, like you said you can find an easy counter example
[6/13/24, 10:44:44 AM] Andrew: Yeah okay I was completely unaware, where did you read this about Tolstoy? Would be neat to know more about the man himself.
[6/13/24, 10:45:26 AM] Matthieu Huss: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354624305_The_influence_of_Leo_Tolstoy_on_the_work_of_european_writers_from_the_standpoint_of_developing_family_themes
[6/13/24, 10:45:53 AM] Andrew: Ooh thanks!
[6/13/24, 10:46:46 AM] Matthieu Huss: Of course, if you can go for more fantastical fiction I’d recommend name of the wind
[6/13/24, 10:47:11 AM] Andrew: Rothfuss?
[6/13/24, 10:47:17 AM] Matthieu Huss: Definitely not as expansive in character settings, it follows one main character, but the prose is nice
[6/13/24, 10:47:25 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yep
[6/13/24, 10:47:45 AM] Andrew: Nice, will check it out! I'm currently reading Wizard of Earthsea, also has pretty nice prose.
[6/13/24, 10:47:46 AM] Matthieu Huss: 3rd book still isn’t out 🥶
[6/13/24, 10:48:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: Hmm interesting never heard of it
[6/13/24, 10:48:15 AM] Andrew: Do you know Ursula Leguin at all?
[6/13/24, 10:48:41 AM] Andrew: (I'll let you know whether it's worthwhile once I finish.)
[6/13/24, 10:49:08 AM] Matthieu Huss: Apparently not, just checked her books don’t recognize any
[6/13/24, 10:49:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: Btw id recommend Plato’s the symposium
[6/13/24, 10:49:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s actually referenced in Anna
[6/13/24, 10:50:42 AM] Andrew: Oh neat! I've not read much Plato directly, that sounds interesting.
[6/13/24, 10:52:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Also if you like the book you’re reading now
[6/13/24, 10:52:24 AM] Matthieu Huss: Tigana is another good one
[6/13/24, 10:52:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s in a renaissance italy / Korean Peninsula kind of setting
[6/13/24, 10:55:32 AM] Andrew: That's not a setting I've seen in a fantasy book...
[6/15/24, 12:08:58 AM] Matthieu Huss: https://apple.news/ARaGLgv9mSUOkdi_jAdSAog :Wonder what your take is on this as someone who is religious. How do you think people, especially the very religious, justify to themselves doing things that are so obviously antithetical to morals that they hold in high esteem
[6/16/24, 2:33:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: Finished Anna Karenina, really escalated at the end there
[6/16/24, 2:33:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: totally agree that Levin is a projection of Tolstoy
[6/17/24, 10:59:19 AM] Andrew: Woah that is so surreal...
[6/17/24, 11:03:41 AM] Andrew: Also the fact that this guy was a Microsoft engineer... I want to say I have no insight into the workings of his mind other than being amazed that any part of this is real 😅
[6/17/24, 11:09:16 AM] Andrew: Though I have run into very religious people who are overprotective of their kids and jerks to anyone perceived as a threat. I guess there's some of the "y'all are the outgroup and evil, morality doesn't apply towards you" idea there. ‎<This message was edited>
[6/17/24, 11:10:06 AM] Andrew: Awesome!! Great book. What are you reading now?
[6/17/24, 11:30:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: Are there any branches of Christianity that that’s part of the doctrine
[6/17/24, 11:30:54 AM] Matthieu Huss: Like save ur kids from the outside
[6/17/24, 11:31:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: Reading a book on the history of financial products
[6/17/24, 11:31:23 AM] Matthieu Huss: And going to start another one called on human nature
[6/17/24, 11:46:49 AM] Andrew: I don't think officially, but there's def various Protestants who really try to shelter their kids from the world
[6/17/24, 11:48:38 AM] Andrew: wonder how well that works for them lol
[6/20/24, 1:10:03 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’d guess either lifetime commitment to the community or very rebellious kids depending on nature ‎<This message was edited>
[6/20/24, 1:10:28 AM] Matthieu Huss: Btw I’m about to wrap up my research paper, would love to get ur input on it if you ever have time
‎[6/20/24, 1:10:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Educ_Mobility-3.pdf • ‎15 pages ‎<attached: 00000390-Educ_Mobility-3.pdf>
[6/20/24, 1:10:52 AM] Matthieu Huss: No rush at all
[6/27/24, 8:03:18 PM] Andrew: Woah, this is really impressive. I don't think I'd be able to give really technical feedback, it's a little outside my area, but was very interesting to read. I was wondering if there are stats on how mother and father's education levels relate to *each other*? Because they've got to be pretty correlated...
[6/27/24, 8:04:36 PM] Andrew: Btw have you read the Three Body Problem? Currently reading and very much enjoying.
[6/27/24, 8:28:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh for sure, very much so. It should be moderately offset by the mixtures but in the end it doesn’t really matter as we are mostly viewing the parental education as a single unit (which is why we summed the coefficients in the end to
Compare models)
[6/27/24, 8:28:57 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah, I think I recommended it to you haha. Finished the three books though I’m pretty sure there’s a side story out
[6/27/24, 8:29:08 PM] Matthieu Huss: About the guy whose brain was taken by the trisolarians
[6/27/24, 8:29:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Love the series, quite different compared to western sci-fi
[6/27/24, 8:29:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’m surprised that first scene got through Chinese censorship tbh
[6/27/24, 8:31:53 PM] Andrew: Oh hahaha!! Right right, of course!
[6/27/24, 8:32:12 PM] Andrew: I think I'm going to read the whole series as well. I can't quite put my finger on what makes it different, but it is. Closest analogue might be Stephenson?
[6/27/24, 8:33:39 PM] Andrew: I feel like China's current position makes this book even more intriguing...
[6/27/24, 8:34:15 PM] Andrew: Right, okay. Just out of personal curiosity, do you have stats on couples education levels easily available?
[6/27/24, 8:39:07 PM] Matthieu Huss: I can easily run it on Gauss, I think we did create the table and I think there was an overall increase in average education for both but especially higher for mothers
[6/27/24, 8:39:37 PM] Matthieu Huss: I think specifically after converting the categories into numbers (1 lt highschool 5 masters) the means increased by like .7
[6/27/24, 8:39:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: I can check tho
[6/27/24, 8:39:51 PM] Andrew: Makes sense, that's what I've anecdotally heard
[6/27/24, 8:40:00 PM] Matthieu Huss: I think it’s the overall emphasis on humanity as a unit
[6/27/24, 8:40:10 PM] Matthieu Huss: Like it doesn’t feel very character driven
[6/27/24, 8:40:21 PM] Matthieu Huss: Like yes we get a decent amount of time with certain characters especially later on
[6/27/24, 8:40:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: But it feels much more like a “big movements” of humanity rather than an Asimov you have more of a single hero for the era
[6/27/24, 8:41:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: Like you follow one specific protagonist who drives the seldon plan or goes against the mule
[6/27/24, 8:41:40 PM] Andrew: Right, interesting, that makes sense. It does seem to be switching points of view, Ye to Wang so far
[6/27/24, 8:41:44 PM] Matthieu Huss: This is more like all of humanity comes together to do something and it’s observing the overall psychi
[6/27/24, 8:41:49 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s very Chinese to me lol
[6/27/24, 8:41:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: Like you focus on the overall process and what the goal is
[6/27/24, 8:42:06 PM] Andrew: But there's also just this feeling of dread that seems more pronounced than usual sci-fi
[6/27/24, 8:42:09 PM] Matthieu Huss: Not single innovator, but everyone pulling together
[6/27/24, 8:42:22 PM] Andrew: Yeah!
[6/27/24, 8:42:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah the inevitability of a big boot coming to squash you
[6/27/24, 8:42:41 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s a very unique environment
[6/27/24, 8:43:01 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’m a big fan of the “science” of it or rather how it’s handled
[6/27/24, 8:43:17 PM] Andrew: Yes exactly... like I feel in Western novels there's more rebellion-against-the-bad-thing, here the bad thing might be quite unstoppable
[6/27/24, 8:43:28 PM] Matthieu Huss: Especially in the first book, it’s like a more realistic way I guess of using technology
[6/27/24, 8:43:46 PM] Andrew: Neat neat, will have to finish reading to comment properly
[6/27/24, 8:44:00 PM] Matthieu Huss: Like the bombs boosting the brain guy rather than just saying “we send the guy to the ships and don’t really think about if it’s time wise possible”
[6/27/24, 8:44:08 PM] Matthieu Huss: Uh oh
[6/27/24, 8:44:12 PM] Matthieu Huss: Did u finish the first book ?
[6/27/24, 8:44:18 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hope I didn’t spoil
[6/27/24, 8:44:21 PM] Matthieu Huss: Definitely worth it
[6/27/24, 8:44:26 PM] Matthieu Huss: I prefer it to foundation
[6/27/24, 8:44:33 PM] Andrew: No I'm a little less than 1/3 into the first book
[6/27/24, 8:44:38 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ahhh
[6/27/24, 8:44:45 PM] Matthieu Huss: Well no worries nothing too spoilery
[6/27/24, 8:45:30 PM] Andrew: Well I think I will get back to tea and Mr. Liu then :D
[6/27/24, 8:45:36 PM] Matthieu Huss: Haha of course
[6/27/24, 8:45:41 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’m watching the president debate
[6/27/24, 8:45:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: Btw
[6/27/24, 8:45:50 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’m getting a place in NY July 20th
[6/27/24, 8:45:56 PM] Andrew: Oh! I didn't realize they were happening that early
[6/27/24, 8:46:04 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll be there until end of August if ur interested in visiting
[6/27/24, 8:46:30 PM] Andrew: Oh sick!! Yes yes of course I'm interested :D
[6/27/24, 8:46:32 PM] Andrew: Where is it?
[6/27/24, 8:46:34 PM] Matthieu Huss: First one! Will probably be shameful
[6/27/24, 8:46:40 PM] Matthieu Huss: Near Central Park
[6/27/24, 8:46:47 PM] Matthieu Huss: It’s my “cousins” place
[6/27/24, 8:46:52 PM] Andrew: Manhattan! Nice...
[6/27/24, 8:46:59 PM] Matthieu Huss: She gets unlimited PTO in her job so she’s going back to Thailand for a month and a half
[6/27/24, 8:47:07 PM] Matthieu Huss: So she’s passing it to me lol
[6/27/24, 8:47:11 PM] Matthieu Huss: Thank god, the rent is brutal
[6/27/24, 8:47:15 PM] Andrew: Hey beautiful
[6/27/24, 8:47:37 PM] Andrew: Sounds like a pretty nice place if it's located like that...
[6/27/24, 8:47:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah I’m sure
[6/27/24, 8:47:53 PM] Matthieu Huss: Haven’t seen it but I’m sure it’s nice
[6/27/24, 8:48:06 PM] Matthieu Huss: Especially bcuz she works for some tech startup
[6/27/24, 8:48:28 PM] Andrew: Oh yeah...

‎[6/28/24, 10:18:15 AM] Andrew: ‎<attached: 00000457-PHOTO-2024-06-28-10-18-15.jpg>
[6/28/24, 10:22:37 AM] Matthieu Huss: God that debate was embarrassing
[6/28/24, 10:22:52 AM] Matthieu Huss: It was so rough for Biden especially at the beginning
[6/28/24, 10:23:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: Idk if u saw but they had a moment where they both said border security supports them
[6/28/24, 10:23:05 AM] Andrew: Yeah no... he really glitched there once
[6/28/24, 10:23:11 AM] Matthieu Huss: And then they tweeted this out
‎[6/28/24, 10:23:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000463-PHOTO-2024-06-28-10-23-15.jpg>
[6/28/24, 10:23:24 AM] Andrew: Yes I saw that hahaha
[6/28/24, 10:23:34 AM] Matthieu Huss: They are talking abt replacing biden for DNC pick
[6/28/24, 10:23:38 AM] Matthieu Huss: Pretty unlikely
[6/28/24, 10:23:48 AM] Matthieu Huss: But just the consideration is crazy
[6/28/24, 10:23:54 AM] Matthieu Huss: Can’t believe he prepped for a week
[6/28/24, 10:24:14 AM] Andrew: yeah no I think he screwed up pretty majorly there
[6/28/24, 10:24:23 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ugh hopefully they will just die before the election so we can get new candidates that aren’t just their vice presidents
[6/28/24, 10:24:36 AM] Andrew: though to be fair I can't say Trump's performance was very inspiring either
[6/28/24, 10:24:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh for sure
[6/28/24, 10:24:48 AM] Matthieu Huss: He basically just lied the whole time
[6/28/24, 10:24:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: Well that’s a bit exaggerated
‎[6/28/24, 10:25:03 AM] Andrew: ‎<attached: 00000475-PHOTO-2024-06-28-10-25-03.jpg>
[6/28/24, 10:25:08 AM] Matthieu Huss: But yeah it was all focused on himself and denying everything
[6/28/24, 10:25:34 AM] Matthieu Huss: lol I’d vote for gpt over them
[6/28/24, 10:25:52 AM] Andrew: ^
[6/28/24, 10:26:03 AM] Matthieu Huss: Whatever I’m registered in Massachusetts
[6/28/24, 10:26:09 AM] Matthieu Huss: Most blue state with California
[6/28/24, 10:26:17 AM] Matthieu Huss: Not like my opinion matters anyways 🥱
[6/28/24, 10:26:20 AM] Andrew: so either way makes no difference?
[6/28/24, 10:26:22 AM] Andrew: ah yea
[6/28/24, 10:26:23 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yep
[6/28/24, 10:26:30 AM] Matthieu Huss: Unless ur in like 6 states no one cares
[6/28/24, 10:26:35 AM] Matthieu Huss: Never seen a campaign rally
[6/28/24, 10:26:44 AM] Matthieu Huss: My friend studies in Pennsylvania and they’re always over there
[6/28/24, 10:26:52 AM] Andrew: Neat...
[6/28/24, 10:26:55 AM] Matthieu Huss: Amazing election system
[6/28/24, 10:27:33 AM] Andrew: I seriously don't know how the states got here
[6/28/24, 10:27:58 AM] Matthieu Huss: I think it’s mostly two party system
[6/28/24, 10:27:59 AM] Andrew: for the last three elections every candidates main selling point was "I'm not the other guy"
[6/28/24, 10:28:20 AM] Matthieu Huss: Plus Americans natural propensity for emotional talk rather than caring what the candidates actually do
[6/28/24, 10:28:32 AM] Matthieu Huss: lol yup
[6/28/24, 10:28:36 AM] Matthieu Huss: Like last night
[6/28/24, 10:28:43 AM] Andrew: That's fair... known bug with democracy
[6/28/24, 10:28:47 AM] Matthieu Huss: Not a single topic on what they will actually do
[6/28/24, 10:28:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s all “they did a bad thing which I will undue”
[6/28/24, 10:29:11 AM] Matthieu Huss: Or “I’ll continue tax cuts that I did”
[6/28/24, 10:29:21 AM] Matthieu Huss: Or just talking about handicaps in golf lmao
[6/28/24, 10:29:48 AM] Andrew: Sky voice for president.
[6/28/24, 10:29:59 AM] Matthieu Huss: Would definitely make more rational decisions
[6/28/24, 10:30:09 AM] Matthieu Huss: Honestly I hope they do replace Biden just not with Kamala
[6/28/24, 10:30:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Probably only person less popular than him
[6/28/24, 10:30:20 AM] Andrew: ahahaha
[6/28/24, 10:30:34 AM] Matthieu Huss: Literally ANYONE who can speak and isn’t actively malicious
[6/28/24, 10:30:40 AM] Matthieu Huss: No exaggeration
[6/28/24, 10:30:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: Only two criteria
[6/28/24, 10:30:45 AM] Andrew: yup...
[6/28/24, 10:30:55 AM] Matthieu Huss: Crazy. Country of 350 million +
[6/28/24, 10:31:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: Very disappointing
[6/28/24, 10:31:24 AM] Matthieu Huss: I think also just the slog of American politics
[6/28/24, 10:31:35 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s even more of a race to the bottom compared to other countries
[6/28/24, 10:31:40 AM] Matthieu Huss: Actually competent people don’t want to run
[6/28/24, 10:31:45 AM] Andrew: I was just thinking, the supreme court seems to be so much more competent than the president
[6/28/24, 10:31:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: Because you see it’s not abt intelligence or policy, just how much u can make ppl hate the other side
[6/28/24, 10:32:18 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, tho I think Canada has a better Supreme Court appointment process
[6/28/24, 10:32:26 AM] Andrew: ugh, maybe that's why there's such a huge divide between the two political camps
[6/28/24, 10:32:30 AM] Matthieu Huss: The US one is being increasingly seen as partisan
[6/28/24, 10:32:53 AM] Matthieu Huss: Because it’s congress who appoints them
[6/28/24, 10:33:04 AM] Andrew: I mean it's pretty random that the Trump presidency got to appoint 3 guys for life
[6/28/24, 10:33:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah exactly
[6/28/24, 10:33:28 AM] Matthieu Huss: They delayed the Obama one even tho legally he should be allowed to appoint
[6/28/24, 10:33:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Because they were banking on trump winning and just filling it
[6/28/24, 10:33:47 AM] Matthieu Huss: So partisan once again
[6/28/24, 10:34:11 AM] Andrew: Right... maybe that's why it gives me good vibes :P
[6/28/24, 10:34:32 AM] Matthieu Huss: lol in what way
[6/28/24, 10:35:08 AM] Andrew: I mean ideally there would be a fair process that represents what people want
[6/28/24, 10:36:28 AM] Andrew: But at least this is skewed in a direction that I generally like rather than vice versa
[6/28/24, 10:36:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: Haha yeah, but it does suck how arbitrary it is
[6/28/24, 10:37:01 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s basically “how many of these guys r going to die while my guy is presiden
[6/28/24, 10:37:01 AM] Andrew: Yeah no
[6/28/24, 10:37:20 AM] Matthieu Huss: To me it seems like an extension of executive and legislative branch
[6/28/24, 10:37:24 AM] Matthieu Huss: Rather than a counterweight
[6/28/24, 10:37:26 AM] Andrew: it's like those card games that have a bunch of luck to make it fun even if the two players are not well-matched
[6/28/24, 10:37:42 AM] Andrew: you never know, a bunch of justices could die!
[6/28/24, 10:37:54 AM] Matthieu Huss: Interestingly I think it would be better if it was even more random
[6/28/24, 10:38:02 AM] Andrew: HA
[6/28/24, 10:38:08 AM] Matthieu Huss: Like if there were multiple parties politically
[6/28/24, 10:38:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: Then there would likely be less consolidation
[6/28/24, 10:38:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: Tho of course there’s always the case that they all die and one party gets all the say
[6/28/24, 10:38:54 AM] Andrew: It feels like it would be good if people could serve for longer without locking us into a terrible candidate. Just because then you plan longer-horizon things rationally
[6/28/24, 10:39:12 AM] Andrew: Well aren't there? They're just not popular!
[6/28/24, 10:39:28 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah, idk if you’d really consider independents a party
[6/28/24, 10:39:36 AM] Matthieu Huss: They vote very consistently with democrats
[6/28/24, 10:39:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: I think Bernie sanders is independent
[6/28/24, 10:40:01 AM] Andrew: Oh right okay
[6/28/24, 10:40:13 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah I understand the rational of life appointments
[6/28/24, 10:40:26 AM] Matthieu Huss: Feel like it should be a judicial panel maybe voted on by the parties
[6/28/24, 10:40:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: Just so there’s the degree of separation
[6/28/24, 10:40:40 AM] Matthieu Huss: And that panel votes on Supreme Court judges
[6/28/24, 10:40:47 AM] Matthieu Huss: But oh well
[6/28/24, 10:40:51 AM] Andrew: Right...
[6/28/24, 10:41:21 AM] Matthieu Huss: I doubt anything’s going to change much in that aspect for the next 4 years legally regardless of the candidate
[6/28/24, 10:41:43 AM] Andrew: yeah all academic
[6/28/24, 10:41:51 AM] Andrew: eventually we might get AI doing some of this
[6/28/24, 10:41:57 AM] Andrew: and that solves issues with transfer of power
[6/28/24, 10:42:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, ppl r going to get realllll interested in bias when that happens
[6/28/24, 10:42:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: I guarantee everyone on each party will say the bot is biased towards the other side
[6/28/24, 10:42:54 AM] Andrew: ahahahaha
[6/28/24, 10:42:55 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yk like Gemini
[6/28/24, 10:43:01 AM] Matthieu Huss: (Tho it definitely was biased lol)
[6/28/24, 10:43:11 AM] Andrew: honestly though OpenAI and Anthropic are reasonably unbiased imo
[6/28/24, 10:43:17 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah agreed
[6/28/24, 10:43:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: Have u checked out Anthropocene new model
[6/28/24, 10:43:30 AM] Matthieu Huss: Claude opus new version I believe
[6/28/24, 10:43:33 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s pretty sick
[6/28/24, 10:43:35 AM] Andrew: Claude Sonnet 3.5?
[6/28/24, 10:43:39 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah
[6/28/24, 10:43:44 AM] Andrew: Yeah! SOTA for coding
[6/28/24, 10:43:53 AM] Andrew: Love using it so far.
[6/28/24, 10:43:58 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah sonnet
[6/28/24, 10:44:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: The coding is much better than 4o imo
[6/28/24, 10:44:13 AM] Matthieu Huss: And faster
[6/28/24, 10:44:18 AM] Andrew: yup 100%
[6/28/24, 10:44:26 AM] Matthieu Huss: It can make whole trading simulations 0 shot
[6/28/24, 10:44:34 AM] Andrew: Niiice
[6/28/24, 10:44:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: Only downside is no access to internet
[6/28/24, 10:44:55 AM] Andrew: Yeah they're a little behind with all the tool use
[6/28/24, 10:45:07 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’m probably going to switch my premium from open to Anthropic unless there’s an announcement soon
[6/28/24, 10:45:08 AM] Andrew: It's pretty decent at math too
[6/28/24, 10:45:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah I saw the specs
[6/28/24, 10:45:36 AM] Andrew: yeah, but just anecdotally it solved a real analysis problem I'd been wondering about for a couple years
‎[6/28/24, 10:45:37 AM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000584-PHOTO-2024-06-28-10-45-37.jpg>
[6/28/24, 10:45:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh nice
[6/28/24, 10:45:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: I had no help from gpt when I was taking it :(
[6/28/24, 10:45:58 AM] Andrew: I'm just keeping both, they update fast enough that I don't think it's worth switching
[6/28/24, 10:46:19 AM] Andrew: Undergrad's going to be different now lol
[6/28/24, 10:46:20 AM] Matthieu Huss: Fair, but I don’t see the benefit of premium for got now
[6/28/24, 10:46:32 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s just more prompts allowed
[6/28/24, 10:46:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s alllllll going to be ai baby
[6/28/24, 10:46:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: It’s kind of scary
[6/28/24, 10:47:07 AM] Matthieu Huss: You see sites like stack overflow having 50% the queries it used to
[6/28/24, 10:47:14 AM] Andrew: yup...
[6/28/24, 10:47:23 AM] Matthieu Huss: With new models there’s basically no need for new information to be generated by humans
[6/28/24, 10:47:34 AM] Andrew: I don't think they're entirely confused when they're saying PhD-level in 18 months
[6/28/24, 10:47:45 AM] Andrew: GPQA is pretty darn hard and they're getting good scores
[6/28/24, 10:47:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: I mean the leaps are crazy
[6/28/24, 10:47:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: I remember using gpt for my trading competition in February
[6/28/24, 10:48:14 AM] Matthieu Huss: All it could do was create basic data structures and just do basic numpy and pandas
[6/28/24, 10:48:20 AM] Matthieu Huss: That was 4 months ago
[6/28/24, 10:48:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: It took me like 60 hours to complete all the code total
[6/28/24, 10:48:44 AM] Matthieu Huss: Now with Anthropics I could easily have done it in 10
[6/28/24, 10:49:21 AM] Andrew: Yeah no Sonnet is a pretty solid jump
[6/28/24, 10:49:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: My friend and I were talking yesterday
[6/28/24, 10:49:53 AM] Andrew: I feel like I'm gradually starting to feel what it means that "these things will be smarter than us" on a gut level
[6/28/24, 10:50:00 AM] Matthieu Huss: He’s going to do a masters in ai
[6/28/24, 10:50:09 AM] Matthieu Huss: We were talking abt what skills will actually be useful
[6/28/24, 10:50:16 AM] Matthieu Huss: Data anslytics is basically dead
[6/28/24, 10:50:27 AM] Matthieu Huss: The path to ai doing all of it itself is pretty clear
[6/28/24, 10:50:49 AM] Andrew: Yeah, I think a bunch of companies are aiming for that pretty explicitly
[6/28/24, 10:50:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: And OpenAI is going to release a data analysis expert gpt soon
[6/28/24, 10:51:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: So it’s like what should we learn now
[6/28/24, 10:51:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: I mean seems like the biggest skill to have is knowing a baseline about subjects
[6/28/24, 10:51:29 AM] Matthieu Huss: So u can know what the right questions to ask are
[6/28/24, 10:51:46 AM] Andrew: Mmm, true, and then you can potentially just do *everything*
[6/28/24, 10:51:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: That plus all the plumbing and manual labor stuff
[6/28/24, 10:52:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: But if u don’t want to do that…. Ur pretty replaceable
[6/28/24, 10:52:15 AM] Andrew: Also things like being well-connected/good at sales pitches
[6/28/24, 10:52:28 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah the people skills
[6/28/24, 10:52:34 AM] Andrew: I think it's just a matter of time for everyone
[6/28/24, 10:52:51 AM] Andrew: Something's going to have to change dramatically
[6/28/24, 10:53:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: Wonder what the solution will be, can’t believe it’s going to be trump or Biden who will be navigating the transition
[6/28/24, 10:53:08 AM] Matthieu Huss: Lots of talk about UBI
[6/28/24, 10:53:13 AM] Matthieu Huss: Sounds pretty far off though
[6/28/24, 10:53:16 AM] Andrew: omg lol
[6/28/24, 10:53:30 AM] Andrew: a lot of this might be happening in the next 4 years...
[6/28/24, 10:53:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, no chance politics can keep up
[6/28/24, 10:53:48 AM] Matthieu Huss: But I mean hey, your job is likely pretty secure
[6/28/24, 10:53:53 AM] Matthieu Huss: Actually working on AI systems
[6/28/24, 10:54:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’m sure there’s going to be lots of demand for that
[6/28/24, 10:54:11 AM] Andrew: Yeah, hopefully... though I'm not very senior yet
[6/28/24, 10:54:46 AM] Matthieu Huss: Climb the ladder before it’s retracted haha
[6/28/24, 10:54:54 AM] Andrew: But yeah, still a *lot* to be done in this area, especially in robotics
[6/28/24, 10:55:06 AM] Andrew: yup lol, that's the plan
[6/28/24, 10:55:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: For sure
[6/28/24, 10:55:35 AM] Matthieu Huss: Robotics definitely hasn’t kept pace with its underlying systems
[6/28/24, 10:55:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: Still waiting to see one folding my laundry :(
[6/28/24, 10:56:16 AM] Matthieu Huss: As in its system can definitely say the steps it needs to take to do a task but seems like there’s a disconnect with hardware
[6/28/24, 10:56:44 AM] Andrew: yeah exactly
[6/28/24, 10:57:23 AM] Andrew: I think also parallelized in-the-real-world reinforcement learning is going to be the way we get more training data
[6/28/24, 10:57:33 AM] Andrew: a robot in every household, learning everything it can
[6/28/24, 10:57:50 AM] Matthieu Huss: Wonder what the constraints would be on that
[6/28/24, 10:58:10 AM] Matthieu Huss: Has to be loose enough to be able to gather enough data but not so free that it can kill a kid first to see if it decreases its reward lol
[6/28/24, 10:58:20 AM] Andrew: hahahaha yep
[6/28/24, 10:58:23 AM] Matthieu Huss: Or more realistically break a glass
[6/28/24, 10:58:32 AM] Andrew: I guess just like normal humans
[6/28/24, 10:58:42 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah the 3 law
[6/28/24, 10:58:44 AM] Matthieu Huss: Laws
[6/28/24, 10:58:51 AM] Matthieu Huss: Or 4
[6/28/24, 10:58:56 AM] Matthieu Huss: Forgot who made them
[6/28/24, 10:59:01 AM] Andrew: Asimov! And yeah 3
[6/28/24, 10:59:11 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ahhhh right
[6/28/24, 10:59:19 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh wait I never made that connection lmaoo
[6/28/24, 10:59:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: I read it in foundation but didnt realize that’s what ppl talk abt
[6/28/24, 10:59:53 AM] Matthieu Huss: Did u ever read the side stories
[6/28/24, 11:00:01 AM] Andrew: Yup, I'm not sure if it was Foundation that it was introduced in
[6/28/24, 11:00:07 AM] Matthieu Huss: I think they were abt the robot wars or something
[6/28/24, 11:00:10 AM] Matthieu Huss: I think it was
[6/28/24, 11:00:12 AM] Andrew: I Robot had a lot about this, and the Caves of Steel trilogy too
[6/28/24, 11:00:28 AM] Andrew: I did read a bunch of his stories, yes
[6/28/24, 11:00:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: Remember character who was in the moon
[6/28/24, 11:00:40 AM] Andrew: Hmm?
[6/28/24, 11:00:56 AM] Matthieu Huss: Oh never mind it was different
[6/28/24, 11:01:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Because it was stated in foundation that robots can’t harm humans or let them come to harm
[6/28/24, 11:01:30 AM] Andrew: Okay, looks like this was a common theme throughout
[6/28/24, 11:02:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ye, I’ll try to find the other books, I stopped at foundation
[6/28/24, 11:02:27 AM] Andrew: Asimov is great, definitely recommend.
[6/28/24, 11:02:37 AM] Andrew: Especially for someone so early.
[6/28/24, 11:03:37 AM] Matthieu Huss: Still, hopefully his vision for what happens in the future (at least in foundation) doesn’t become too accurate
[6/28/24, 11:03:45 AM] Matthieu Huss: Robotic war would suck
[6/28/24, 11:04:16 AM] Andrew: At least foundation basically works out long-term
[6/28/24, 11:07:21 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah … wasn’t a big fan of how the future basically turns to everyone being absorbed into a cosmic consciousness
[6/28/24, 11:07:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’d hope my future turns out differently 😇
[6/28/24, 11:07:40 AM] Andrew: Same here.
[6/28/24, 11:08:05 AM] Andrew: But I think we might be living in the most interesting period of all history so far.
[6/28/24, 11:08:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: Absolutely
‎[7/6/24, 3:53:14 PM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000678-PHOTO-2024-07-06-15-53-14.jpg>
[7/6/24, 4:48:21 PM] Andrew: Omg what you got it! I figured you’d have a long stack of other things to read…
[7/6/24, 6:10:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: Finished them ;)
[7/6/24, 6:10:50 PM] Matthieu Huss: Well most
[7/6/24, 6:11:01 PM] Matthieu Huss: A few of them I started and didn’t find too interesting
[7/6/24, 6:11:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: How far along are u in 3 body problem ?
[7/6/24, 6:49:49 PM] Andrew: Finished the first, starting the second!
[7/6/24, 6:50:02 PM] Andrew: First was fantastic, actually I forget if we discussed this after I finished it.
[7/6/24, 9:16:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: no, i thought u finished and might have given minor spoilers lol
[7/6/24, 9:16:35 PM] Matthieu Huss: book 2 is probably my favorite 😉
[7/10/24, 9:10:05 AM] Matthieu Huss: Finished a personal matter
[7/10/24, 9:10:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: Damn it’s dark
[7/10/24, 9:11:03 AM] Matthieu Huss: Wondering why the guy seems to have 0 second thoughts or guilt of leaving his wife in a hospital bed to go cavort with another woman
[7/10/24, 9:11:41 AM] Matthieu Huss: And the ending seems to be one of those “other world” endings
[7/10/24, 9:13:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: Overall it reminds me a lot of Dostoevsky’s books
[7/10/24, 9:14:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: Very gritty but not self indulgent. Could feel the inner conflicts that came from having no self control; it’s motivating to  the reader to develop that control so you don’t even up like that 😅
[7/10/24, 10:06:36 AM] Andrew: Awesome!! You're the first person I've been able to discuss this with, I've been a little hesitant to recommend it just because of how dark and graphic it is.
[7/10/24, 10:07:57 AM] Andrew: Yeah the wife barely features in the story at all...
[7/10/24, 10:11:46 AM] Andrew: Something that struck me about this book is that despite the character being fairly despicable, the author's still "on his side," as it were. Like, he's still human and can still redeem himself. I was kind of struck by how much empathy I felt towards this dude. Kind of like what we were talking about with Camus. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/10/24, 10:12:06 AM] Andrew: What do you mean here?
[7/10/24, 10:14:31 AM] Andrew: Yeah this book occasionally pops up in my head when contemplating life choices lol
[7/10/24, 10:16:43 AM] Matthieu Huss: They were talking about the parallel universe theory (a universe where Himiko’s husband was still alive etc.), and the starkness of the choices at the end (leave to Africa with Himiko and abandon responsibility, accept responsibility and go back to your family) as well as how it was framed with Bird pondering how it would have been if he went on the boat
[7/10/24, 10:17:10 AM] Matthieu Huss: I guess to me it was the message at the end like you said that you can always be redeemed
[7/10/24, 10:17:36 AM] Matthieu Huss: but to me i found it was more “if he had chosen responsibility  this what his life would have been like”
[7/10/24, 10:17:50 AM] Andrew: Oh my gosh, I didn't make that connection at all
[7/10/24, 10:18:04 AM] Matthieu Huss: maybe just how everyone ended up praising him and looking up to him felt a bit “otherworldly” to me
[7/10/24, 10:18:31 AM] Matthieu Huss: as in a bit out of touch with reality, where there would definietly have been consequences for him taking the kid away and bringing it back with pneumonia
[7/10/24, 10:19:04 AM] Andrew: Right... I should re-read this ending again, yeah, I totally missed that.
[7/10/24, 10:19:12 AM] Matthieu Huss: and Himiko validly asked how they would operaet a baby that sick when the doctors had stated earlier on that they needed the baby to have strength to even bother operating
[7/10/24, 10:19:36 AM] Matthieu Huss: but yeah… just those things together makes me feel like we are looking into an alternate universe at the end where he made the right choices
[7/10/24, 10:20:38 AM] Andrew: That's such a cool idea
[7/10/24, 10:21:10 AM] Matthieu Huss: but now im looking at what other ppl are saying online and ppl have very different atkes haha
[7/10/24, 10:21:26 AM] Matthieu Huss: seems likke the consensus is that it’s real and the japanese sense of duty shines through at the end
[7/10/24, 10:21:34 AM] Matthieu Huss: and that’s the kind of ending message
[7/10/24, 10:22:12 AM] Andrew: Making it an alternate universe definitely does make the message a lot less straightforward to interpret
[7/10/24, 10:23:53 AM] Matthieu Huss: To me it was like you can look through two windows. One where you live up to your duties, and the other where you run away
[7/10/24, 10:24:29 AM] Andrew: This makes me think now, the moral framework here is probably subtly different from Dostoyevsky's, Japanese vs Orthodox
[7/10/24, 10:25:08 AM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll also reread it because I didn’t really get the significance of the American diplomat scenes
[7/10/24, 10:25:19 AM] Matthieu Huss: the connection i saw was tthat this man was choosing happiness over duyt
[7/10/24, 10:25:21 AM] Matthieu Huss: but it worked out
[7/10/24, 10:25:32 AM] Andrew: I don't remember the American diplomat at all
[7/10/24, 10:25:33 AM] Matthieu Huss: but obviously that would conflict with the general idea
[7/10/24, 10:25:44 AM] Matthieu Huss: there was htis diplomat who was holing up with his japanese girlfriend
[7/10/24, 10:26:02 AM] Matthieu Huss: and they emphasized how they didn’t even speak hte same language but clearly loved each other
[7/10/24, 10:26:33 AM] Andrew: Okay yeah that rings a bell
[7/10/24, 10:27:05 AM] Matthieu Huss: to me the “interpretation” of this was that for some people (americans) chasing pleasure is fulfilling, but others need to choose duty (japanese)
[7/10/24, 10:27:15 AM] Matthieu Huss: not very strong though
[7/10/24, 10:29:23 AM] Andrew: Hmm... perhaps, though I feel like it's probably a little more complex
[7/10/24, 10:31:10 AM] Andrew: Though I really need to reread it, it's been a few years.
[7/10/24, 10:32:16 AM] Matthieu Huss: So you might, as Oe did in A Personal Matter, use a different word in place of “faith.” In the book, Bird goes to visit a friend, a Balkan diplomat who has abandoned his own duties and taken up with a Japanese girl, and tells him he has left his son to die. The diplomat is upset: “Kafka, you know,” he tells him, “wrote in a letter to his father, the only thing a parent can do for a child is to welcome it when it arrives.” Before they part, he gives Bird a dictionary in which he inscribes the Slavic word for “hope.” Later, at the end of the book, Bird thinks of this and decides that when he is home with his son, he will look up the word “forbearance.
[7/10/24, 10:32:22 AM] Matthieu Huss: from an online review ^
[7/10/24, 10:33:03 AM] Matthieu Huss: I guess that kills the theory that diplomat is meant to represent just chasing your desire
[7/10/24, 10:33:34 AM] Matthieu Huss: though i guess him doing just that by abandoning everything to be with his gf contrasts nicely with him telling Bird his responsibility as a father
[7/10/24, 10:33:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: Some duties are important even to a man who “deserts” his country ‎<This message was edited>
[7/10/24, 10:35:02 AM] Andrew: This, I think the contrast is more between what sort of duty is ultimately “optional” and what isn’t
[7/10/24, 10:35:41 AM] Andrew: Actually that’s such a cool contrast too
[7/11/24, 2:44:40 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah it’s a great read
[7/11/24, 2:44:45 PM] Matthieu Huss: Will look into his other works
[7/11/24, 2:45:00 PM] Matthieu Huss: Weirdly im even more pumped to visit Japan now haha
[7/11/24, 2:45:39 PM] Andrew: I’ve found anyone who’s won a Nobel Prize has been consistently good
[7/11/24, 2:46:16 PM] Andrew: Can’t wait to start reading the second Cixin Liu book once the chaos at work dies down a little
[7/11/24, 2:48:31 PM] Matthieu Huss: Oh yeah it’s good
[7/11/24, 2:48:42 PM] Matthieu Huss: How are the SQL process translations going
[7/11/24, 2:50:40 PM] Andrew: Great, lots of fun, but parallel un-memory safe code is the most cursed
[7/11/24, 2:50:59 PM] Andrew: How's the internship going?
[7/11/24, 2:51:03 PM] Andrew: What are you working on specifically now?
[7/11/24, 2:51:54 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll take ur word for it considering I don’t even know what that is haha
[7/11/24, 2:52:16 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah it’s a bit slow, I finished my solo project and am trying to push it to prod.
[7/11/24, 2:52:34 PM] Matthieu Huss: Apparently IT hasn’t put anything in prod for the last 8 months
[7/11/24, 2:52:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: In the meantime just some data analytics, Python power BI stuff
‎[7/11/24, 2:53:15 PM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000748-VIDEO-2024-07-11-14-53-15.mov>
[7/11/24, 2:53:58 PM] Matthieu Huss: Here was the V1 prototype, it’s much faster (thank god) and has a wider reach now
[7/11/24, 2:58:31 PM] Andrew: Ooh, wait, so does this scrape various internet sources and compile a profile about a person?
[7/11/24, 2:59:00 PM] Andrew: Hahaha, yeah, definitely the annoying part of software development
[7/11/24, 3:03:24 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah, I specify some domains (LinkedIn and a few others) to hit, and then just grab top 5 Google results that aren’t included in the original list, take the HTML and clean it and compile it into a prespecified format. And then it just grabs the first image on Google search tbh, sometimes it’s a bit weird, and then everything is put into a word doc that you download to ur phone / laptop
[7/11/24, 3:04:13 PM] Andrew: Cool!! Do you think LLMs might ever be useful for this, or too slow?
[7/11/24, 3:05:04 PM] Matthieu Huss: I use mistrals model hosted through Google collab haha
[7/11/24, 3:05:22 PM] Matthieu Huss: Bcuz for it to understand the format that needs to be output it would need to be pretrained for context etc
[7/11/24, 3:05:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: And obviously don’t have the compute for that
[7/11/24, 3:05:30 PM] Andrew: Mistral! Interesting, why'd you choose that one?
[7/11/24, 3:05:39 PM] Matthieu Huss: It has a 7b that’s pretty good
[7/11/24, 3:05:43 PM] Matthieu Huss: Plus it’s uncensored
[7/11/24, 3:06:36 PM] Andrew: Nice, okay, and you wanted to run it locally?
[7/11/24, 3:06:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: Well that’s the idea in the end
[7/11/24, 3:06:59 PM] Matthieu Huss: Of course using Collab kind of defeats that in this case
[7/11/24, 3:07:10 PM] Matthieu Huss: But just wanted to show it was possible without needing a direct API key
[7/11/24, 3:07:23 PM] Matthieu Huss: In that hopefully I can have them run the model on a nice computer at the bank
[7/11/24, 3:07:34 PM] Matthieu Huss: I didn’t do that directly bcuz my laptop can’t handle it
[7/11/24, 3:07:40 PM] Andrew: Cool, yeah, banks probably do prefer to do everything locally
[7/11/24, 3:07:50 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah confidentiality and such
[7/12/24, 9:07:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: Hey I’m at a dinner and ur Japanese rum came up lol
[7/12/24, 9:07:36 PM] Matthieu Huss: What was it called again
[7/12/24, 9:07:45 PM] Matthieu Huss: The one that was kind of burned on some kind of cask / herb
[7/12/24, 9:15:48 PM] Andrew: I wanna say the Japanese whiskey was Yoichi
[7/12/24, 9:16:18 PM] Andrew: But the stuff that had a lot of peat (the moss they used to create smoke) would have been Laphroaig
[7/12/24, 9:23:12 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ahhh right thanks
‎[7/17/24, 8:06:20 PM] Matthieu Huss: ‎<attached: 00000774-PHOTO-2024-07-17-20-06-20.jpg>
[7/17/24, 8:07:28 PM] Andrew: Hell yeah!! When are you moving into your apartment?
[7/17/24, 8:08:06 PM] Matthieu Huss: Saturday
[7/17/24, 8:08:11 PM] Matthieu Huss: Finally no more Airbnb
[7/17/24, 8:08:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll be here until Aug 23
[7/17/24, 8:08:31 PM] Andrew: Beautiful, what if I were to come the weekend of the 26th?
[7/17/24, 8:08:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: July ?
[7/17/24, 8:08:49 PM] Andrew: Yep
[7/17/24, 8:08:53 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah that would work !
[7/17/24, 8:09:21 PM] Andrew: Alright!! Let me try to confirm, but I think there's nothing else happening then. This would be so cool!!!
[7/17/24, 8:09:33 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah of course man, there’s so much to do here
[7/17/24, 8:09:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: Just lmk to confirm
[7/17/24, 8:51:46 PM] Matthieu Huss: There’s this Russian restaurant in queens that my piano teacher told me to go
[7/17/24, 8:51:52 PM] Matthieu Huss: You’re going to my Russian to authenticate it
[7/18/24, 11:43:02 AM] Andrew: Ooh, which one?
[7/18/24, 11:43:25 AM] Andrew: My Russian skills are at your service :D
[7/18/24, 12:32:35 PM] Matthieu Huss: Well there r two but probably will go to this one
[7/18/24, 12:32:38 PM] Matthieu Huss: Cheburechnaya
[7/18/24, 12:32:48 PM] Matthieu Huss: I’ll leave it to you to translate 😌

[7/22/24, 11:20:33 AM] Andrew: What if I were to come in Saturday morning?
[7/22/24, 11:20:57 AM] Andrew: What's the address btw?
[7/22/24, 11:21:57 AM] Matthieu Huss: https://maps.app.goo.gl/d9BqLpU23MXkzbBF7?g_st=ic

[7/22/24, 11:22:40 AM] Andrew: Wow beautiful, right next to Central Park!
[7/22/24, 11:22:48 AM] Andrew: I was thinking of flying in
[7/22/24, 11:23:49 AM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah it’s nice, robbed it from my cousin lol
[7/22/24, 11:23:52 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ok ok sounds good

[7/22/24, 11:24:09 AM] Matthieu Huss: Lmk when u land and I can pick u up
[7/22/24, 11:24:58 AM] Andrew: The Saturday flights are all into EWR, might be a bit of a commute no?
[7/22/24, 11:30:39 AM] Matthieu Huss: Ah ok not LaGuardia
[7/22/24, 11:32:05 AM] Matthieu Huss: 👌 lmk when ur landing is and I can plan stuff around it

[7/24/24, 12:44:04 PM] Andrew: Awesome. If I were to stay until next Saturday, would that work? (Absolutely no worries if you have other people coming over/it would be tight/anything, can definitely head out earlier too.) ‎<This message was edited>
[7/24/24, 1:20:31 PM] Matthieu Huss: Yeah for sure that works
[7/24/24, 1:20:35 PM] Matthieu Huss: Just bring a blanket lol ‎<This message was edited>

[7/24/24, 1:21:07 PM] Andrew: Amazing alright!
[7/26/24, 9:00:29 PM] Matthieu Huss: Ready to go?!?!
[7/26/24, 9:00:38 PM] Matthieu Huss: Also is there anything in particular you need/want to do here ?
